            <h2>Research Form Design</h2>
            <h3>January 15th, 2025</h3>
            <p>After reading through the article I found that it was helpful as a quick cheat sheet for the best practice when it comes to creating forms or text boxs on websites. The first part of the article talks about the value of having less input fields. People on the web do not want to spend a long amount of time filling in information, which is why “less is more” when it comes to gathering information. In the new age of short attention spans, this is more true than it has ever been.</p>
            <p>Another important aspect of form design comes from the labeling for the text box. The label should always be outside of the box and not inside the text box. Mainly so that the user still knows what the text entry is supposed to be. If the label is inside of the text field, it disappears once they start typing. Other common practices are to minimize the use of the dropdown menu and providing a matching keyboard for the action at hand.</p>
            <p>Overall these are just some of the common practices for coding forms on websites and apps.</p>

            <h2>Lightship - Innovative Web Design</h2>
            <h3>January 17th, 2025</h3>
            <p>The Lightship website is innovative and puts on a show for the viewer, with a large title card video that is dynamic once you start to scroll down. This website is also minimalist, which gives the page room to breath and it makes it very easy to navigate.</p>
